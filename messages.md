Jay, it’s truly been a pleasure working with you these past few years. Your patience and ability to coach technical skill has really made a difference to my time at Hyde and a combination of which the team will not be able to replace.
Please don’t be a stranger and good luck with the new adventure, I am sure you'll smash it.
